## ⚠️ URGENT: Legacy Sensor Migration Required

**If you have deprecation warnings about template sensors**, you need to migrate before HA 2026.6:

🚨 **46+ legacy sensors will stop working in HA 2026.6**

**Quick Fix (15 min):**
1. Add new pricing files to `configuration.yaml`
2. Replace old `sensors.yaml` with migrated version
3. Update dashboard sensor references
4. Restart Home Assistant

👉 **See [QUICK_MIGRATION.md](QUICK_MIGRATION.md) for 3-step fix**
